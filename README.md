## Introduction
Assume that a high-dimensional data set lies on a lower-dimensional manifold. Diffusion maps reveals structures of such data set by connecting the geometry of the underlying manifold to the spectral properties of a Markov process on it.

### :mag: *Why should we use diffusion maps?*
- rigorous theoretical support
- allow data in data space to have non-linear shape
- robust to noise perturbation 

  
### :mag: *How diffusion maps work?*


***Affinity matrix K***
- K represents a weighted graph on the data set, where edges indicate the affinities between pairwise data points.

***Diffusion matrix P***
- By normalizing rows of K, P represents a random walk on the weighted graph. 
- Let t > 0 be a time parameter, P^t(x,y) (x,y are two data points) represents the probability of jumping from x to y in t steps of a random walk. 

***Diffusion distance of time t***
- Diffusion distance of time t, DD_t(x,y) = || P^t(x,.) - P^t(y,.) ||. 
- DD_t introduces a new relationship between two data points. 
- DD_t is small if there is a large number of short paths connecting x,y.

***Diffusion map of time t, Y_t***
- By using the first k largest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P^t, Y_t maps data from data space to a k-dimensional Euclidean space. 
- Dimension reduction is done by neglecting certain eigenvalues and their eigenvectors, since the value of an eigenvalue indicates its importance.
- The usual Euclidean distance in the k-dimensional Euclidean space is equal to the diffusion distance in the original data space.  


## Algorithm
There are various ways to construct a diffusion map. Here are the introductions to the three different algorithms in this repository. 

:round_pushpin: Construction 1: `DM-AnnLeeMethod.ipynb`.

- Based on [Ann Lee's Matlab code](https://reurl.cc/E3Ykv), it is my first sight to diffusion maps.  
- Allows one to increase the time parameter t.

    (I found that t = 1 is enough for my data sets to have good embedding results, hence I omitted choosing t in the following constructions.) 

:round_pushpin: Construction 2, `DM-ManorMethod.ipynb`.
- Based on paper [3]. 
- Improves construction 1 by picking a manually selected parameter automatically.

:round_pushpin: Construction 3, `DM.ipynb`.
- Based on paper [1]. 

Steps of these constructions are further stated in the corresponding `.ipynb` files. 

## Demonstration
All three algorithms can effectively cluster data points. This section demonstrates some results using the third construction. 

Note that after obtaining the diffusion map, I clusters data points in the k-dimensional Euclidean space using the KMeans algorithm and obtains a label for each data point.
